InfoMe
======

At the moment this is a basic relay bot done with node.js and jQuery, designed to hook into the GroupMe API
and provide some basic information to a groupchat.

Currently supported functionalities are:
Output from local Linux commands (via execSync), e.g. fortune, sensors
Weather forecasting (via Weather Underground)
Basic time and date
Merriam-Webster dictionary lookup (via mw-dictionary) - not quite working yet

Work is needed to get image support working and to clean up the code.
